					You might ask if this is a Tiger onesie and I might answer that this is in fact a Tiger onesie and that I am in fact wearing it at work.  You might suggest that I'm a little odd but I might suggest that I'm in fact awesome.  You might say that I'm a tiger and I might say that I'm not the only one.
