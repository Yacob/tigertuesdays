					This shirt has a bedazzle which is pretty fancy. I found it in Taiwan and got a little peer pressured into buying it. Probably required no peer pressure at all.

					You might ask if this is a Tiger onesie and I might answer that this is in fact a Tiger onesie and that I am in fact wearing it at work.  You might suggest that I'm a little odd but I might suggest that I'm in fact awesome.  You might say that I'm a tiger and I might say that I'm not the only one.

					It was really dark and a little bit scary hanging out in the woods looking for tigers and/or sasquatch.  Luckily ain't no one messes with a kid wearing a YOLO Tiger shirt.  I can attest to that.

					So I'm not perfect because I'm not a tiger.  I forgot to take a picture of me in my rockin' tiger shirt so in lieu of that, I present this tiger I painted.  His name is Rudy and the title of the painting is "rudy the regal tiger".  If you ever want to paint wildlife with me, hit me up.

					An oldie but a goodie.  This is my very first tiger shirt, gifted to me on my 19th? birthday. Really the first important day of my life.  When I became an ambassador to those who just sort of like tigers from those who like Tigers bordering on a creepy obsession. 

					Its not creepy, its just sort of an obsession.

					Lance is lucky I talked to my boy Keith on the help chat about getting this photo rotated.  I dunno about going in and rotating the picture on my computer before uploading.  It seems like a hassle, but this majestic all seeing tiger god of a shirt and the guy wearing it deserve it.

					Very Tiger Much Class

					Huge shout out to Monica and Jon of Mr Bills for this shirt. I showed up in just the shirt but I had to wear a second shirt just so my coworkers could work near me without being blown away by the awesomeness of it.

					I'll figure out how to rotate this eventually.
					(UPDATE) I Figured it out, just to lazy.

					First recorded Tiger Tuesday.  Based on records, it likely happened 2014, October 28th.  A day that will live in famy.

					This Tiger ponders the universe and wonders how many Tigers live out in the stars.
