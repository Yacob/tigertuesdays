Tiger Tuesday started as a dream of a nerd. A dream to share his love of Tigers and the awesomeness of Tigers.  Its not just about the stripes you wear on your clothes, but the stripes you wear on your heart.  Tiger Tuesday is the mindset of champions.  

Tuesday is a day meant for wearing Tiger apparel and being the Tiger.  Be super awesome. Wear Tiger. Be Tiger.

The majority of people prefer to wear clothes with pictures or graphics of Tigers or representing sports teams named after Tigers on Tuesday.  In both cases, representing the Tiger and its spirit is whats most important.  Sometimes people actually dress up like Tigers. Everyone is really jealous of those people.
